**Estimating Vegetation Traversal Cost for Autonomous Mobile Robots (2019)**

Started in 2017 and finished in 2019, this research paper served as my first introduction to computer vision, scene understnading, practical robotics, and deep learning as a whole. Through reading 50+ scientific papers on a specific domain I was able to gain a whole new understanding on determining the most up to date models and algorithms for my application, while learning the complexities of the systems in great detail. 




**Abstract**

"This paper proposes a system architecture to calculate energy costs and resistive forces of vegetation traversal for autonomous off-road robots. An advanced semantic segmentation algorithm and dataset are discussed to first classify vegetation at a level lower than ever before for autonomous mobile robots. For each class, a regression model would be built to calculate costs and forces through experimentation using lidar and stereo vision, and then updated continuously in-field with unsupervised online learning."
